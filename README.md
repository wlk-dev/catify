# Catify
By William, Mariam, Tarek & Dong 


## Description

Catify is a tool designed to convert a user’s profile into a cat. It works by prompting the user to input their name and theme color of choice. Catify then uses various API’s to provide the user with a compatible cat breed, age in cat years, gender and country of origin. The motivation behind this project was to build a fun interactive game that leverages various APIs.

The tech stack consists of bootstrap HTML to create two separate pages. The first page uses two input forms, username and color. Then, the data is fed to an object that calls four different APIs. The output data is then stored into an object which populates the result, a user generated card. In addition, as the user plays additional times, the data saves to local storage and creates “saved cards” dynamically at the bottom of the page using JQuery. Lastly, we used additional technologies called Swiper and Coloris to enhance the user interface.


   

## Installation 
This code does not require any installation. The HTMLs, JavaScrip files, CSS and images are provided. You can simply click the URL for the finished product.

## Usage 
Catify is very simple and straight forward to use, as shown in the screenshot. The user will enter their name and preferred theme color and click submit. The user will be redirected to a second page and displayed the main card or the finished output. The user will have the option to play again by clicking the the "Home" link on the left top of the page. There they can input thier friends or family's names to turn them into a cat!
